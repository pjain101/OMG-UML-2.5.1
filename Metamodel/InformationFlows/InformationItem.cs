    ///     may move within a system, but do not elaborate details of the transferred
    ///     information.  Details of transferred information are the province of other
    ///     Classifiers that may ultimately define InformationItems.  Consequently,
    ///     InformationItems cannot be instantiated and do not themselves have features,
    ///     generalizations, or associations. An important use of InformationItems is to
    ///     represent information during early design stages, possibly before the detailed
    ///     modeling decisions that will ultimately define them have been made. Another
    ///     purpose of InformationItems is to portions of complex models in less
    ///     precise, but perhaps more general and communicable, ways.
